# Arduino-Temperature-Sensor

This project represent using of temperature sensor in a simple project. When the temperature is above particular value (default *21 degree*) the green diode is turned on. Respectively if the temperature is higher than *23 degree* - the red diode is turned on and so on and so on.

**Schematic of the circuit:**
